{"name":"Skyperious","body":"Skyperious is a Skype database viewer and merger, written in Python.\r\n\r\nIt can open local Skype SQLite databases and look at their contents:\r\n\r\n- search across all messages and contacts\r\n- browse, filter and export chat histories, see chat statistics\r\n- view any database table and and export their data\r\n- change, add or delete data in any table\r\n- execute direct SQL queries\r\n\r\nSkyperious can also compare two Skype databases, show the differences in chats\r\nand contacts, and copy any spotted differences from one database to another.\r\nSkype uses local database files to keep its chat history, and older messages\r\ntend to get lost as computers get upgraded or changed. Skyperious was initially\r\nwritten to import old chat messages from such files.\r\n\r\nCurrently released in alpha status: browsing is seemingly stable, merging\r\nhas not been extensively tested and might have issues. It is recommended to\r\nmake a backup of the database file before making any changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing The Program\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nRun skyperious.bat under Windows, or skyperious.sh where shell scripts are\r\nsupported, or execute 'python main.py'. Or launch skyperious_0.9.3a.exe if\r\nusing the precompiled Windows executable.\r\n\r\nSkyperious can look through user directories and detect Skype databases\r\nautomatically, or you can select files yourself.\r\n\r\nSkyperious has been tested under Windows XP, Windows Vista and Ubuntu Linux,\r\nits core functionality should work wherever Python and required Python\r\npackages are installed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\nSkyperious requires Python 2.7 and uses these 3rd-party Python packages:\r\n\r\n* wxPython 2.9 (http://wxpython.org/)\r\n* Python Imaging Library, required by wxPython\r\n  (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)\r\n* BeautifulSoup 3.2.0, already included\r\n  (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup)\r\n* pywin32, not required: used for launching/shutting down Skype\r\n  (https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/)\r\n\r\nSkyperious also runs under Python 2.6 and wxPython 2.8, but with some quirks.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttribution\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nDefault avatar icon from:\r\n  Fancy Avatars, (c) 2009 Brandon Mathis,\r\n  http://brandonmathis.com/projects/fancy-avatars/\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2011-2012 by Erki Suurjaak\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
