        <p>Skyperious is a Skype database viewer and merger, written in Python.</p>

<p>It can open local Skype SQLite databases and look at their contents:</p>

<ul>
<li>search across all messages and contacts</li>
<li>browse, filter and export chat histories, see chat statistics</li>
<li>view any database table and and export their data</li>
<li>change, add or delete data in any table</li>
<li>execute direct SQL queries</li>
</ul><p>Skyperious can also compare two Skype databases, show the differences in chats
and contacts, and copy any spotted differences from one database to another.
Skype uses local database files to keep its chat history, and older messages
tend to get lost as computers get upgraded or changed. Skyperious was initially
written to import old chat messages from such files.</p>

<p>Currently released in alpha status: browsing is seemingly stable, merging
has not been extensively tested and might have issues. It is recommended to
make a backup of the database file before making any changes.</p>

<h2>Using The Program</h2>

<p>Run skyperious.bat under Windows, or skyperious.sh where shell scripts are
supported, or execute 'python main.py'. Or launch skyperious_0.9.3a.exe if
using the precompiled Windows executable.</p>

<p>Skyperious can look through user directories and detect Skype databases
automatically, or you can select files yourself.</p>

<p>Skyperious has been tested under Windows XP, Windows Vista and Ubuntu Linux,
its core functionality should work wherever Python and required Python
packages are installed.</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

<p>Skyperious requires Python 2.7 and uses these 3rd-party Python packages:</p>

<ul>
<li>wxPython 2.9 (<a href="http://wxpython.org/">http://wxpython.org/</a>)</li>
<li>Python Imaging Library, required by wxPython
(<a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/</a>)</li>
<li>BeautifulSoup 3.2.0, already included
(<a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup">http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup</a>)</li>
<li>pywin32, not required: used for launching/shutting down Skype
(<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/</a>)</li>
</ul><p>Skyperious also runs under Python 2.6 and wxPython 2.8, but with some quirks.</p>
